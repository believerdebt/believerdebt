# jay why the fuck did you name your alt account believerdebt it's not even cool :kekw:
i will forever be an astralspiff fan and unfortunately i am a believer. im never beating the debt allegations spiff give me my balls back ???

# i didn't really set up a dni list on my main account but i probably should, so here are some of my dnis that i can think of right now ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧
proshippers + darkshippers, transphobes, homophobes, zoophiles .. well would you look at that .. basic dni in general + minors under 13/adults over 27* and anti age regressors ?? if thats a
thing. basically if you have a problem with age regressing yeah block me. i age regress as a coping mechanism for childhood trauma. got a problem with that? shove it in your ass. and if you don't like it? shove it further!
i shouldn't even have to say this but age regressing is NOT age play. it's a perfectly healthy and SAFE FOR WORK (SFW) coping mechanism a lot of people use for different traumas, mostly
childhood trauma.

*yes im fully aware some of my f/os are older than that (blinks at my phigting f/os) and that some of the streamers i watch are also over the specified age (spiff is 28 as far as i know from google)
but that doesnt mean im not allowed to feel uncomfortable since most fellow adults i met here (21-39) were .. ew. just .. ew. aside from blizzo if you see this hi blizzo!!

# also yes, i am a yumeshipper !! (a sharing one, doubles are encouraged to interact hell yeah)

# please DO interact though, if .. ₍₍⚞(˶>ᗜ<˶)⚟⁾⁾
